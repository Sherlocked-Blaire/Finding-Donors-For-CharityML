# Finding-Donors-For-CharityML
Project one (Supervised learning)  for completion of Udacity's Introduction to Machine Learning NanoDegree

## Project Overview

In this project, you will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. You will first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, you will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. You will then evaluate several supervised learners of your choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, you will optimize the model you've selected and present it as your solution to CharityML. Finally, you will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.

## Project Highlights
This project is designed to get you acquainted with the many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and to also provide for a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.

Things you will learn by completing this project:
- How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
- How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
- What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
- How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.
